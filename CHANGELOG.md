# Changelog

*English · [Français](CHANGELOG.fr.md)*

All notable changes to the EDRockMaster plugin. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Bounty hunting panel: when only combat bonds are earned, the status reads **Conflict zone** and the empty bounty line is left out.
- Checked against a real conflict zone session (game 4.4.1.1): combat bonds, active time, redemption and community goal figures match the game. Bounties themselves remain to be checked in game.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- **Bounty hunting** (design decision ADR 0011, in the project's architecture repository): a hunting session starts with the first bounty or combat bond and ends on death, game exit or **Reset**; docking and jumps do not end it. Statistics: active time (pauses over 15 minutes left out), kills and shared kills, bounties, combat bonds, credits per hour. Unredeemed vouchers, which are lost on death. Community goals: contribution, percentile band, tier reached.
- The panel shows the activity in progress, mining or bounty hunting; **Reset** acts on it.

### Known limitations

- Unredeemed vouchers are known only from the moment EDMC started: the game journal does not restate older ones.
- The bounty hunting counter has not been checked against a real hunting session yet: please enable the journal recorder while hunting and report any wrong figure.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-03

First version, for the first in-game test. The plugin works on its own, without any server.

### Added

- **Prospector alerts**: a threshold per commodity, in percent of the asteroid. Defaults: platinum and low temperature diamonds 20 %, painite, osmium, palladium and gold 25 %. Also a minimum content level, an optional minimum remaining reserve, an alert on cores (motherlodes), and a sound. An asteroid prospected twice within 60 seconds raises only one alert.
- **Mining sessions**: a session starts with the first mining activity and ends on supercruise, jump, docking, game exit or the **Reset** button. Active time leaves out pauses longer than 10 minutes. Statistics: tons per commodity, tons per hour, refinements, asteroids prospected, cores found and cracked, limpets launched, cargo. Sales of the mined tons after the session are added to it (tons and credits).
- **Panel** in EDMC's main window and **preferences tab** in EDMC's settings.
- **English and French**, following EDMC's language, without restart.
- **Journal recorder** (off by default): keeps a copy of the journal events in JSONL files, to build test data and report bugs.
- EDMC started while the game is already running: the current ring is known.

### Known limitations

- No link with EDRockMaster services yet (sign-in, uploads): planned for the next version.
- No estimated value of the cargo: it needs the server's prices.
- Not checked yet: EDMC's dark theme, the alert sound on Windows.
